#Finding the Minimum: For each position in the array, the algorithm finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion and swaps it with the current position.

#Outer Loop: The outer loop goes through each element in the array to place the smallest element in the correct position.

#Inner Loop: The inner loop compares the current element with the remaining unsorted elements to find the minimum.

#Swapping: Once the minimum element is found, it is swapped with the element at the current position.

#Time Complexity: The time complexity of Selection Sort is O(nÂ²), where n is the number of elements. This is because for each element, the algorithm scans the entire remaining unsorted portion.

#Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) because the sorting is done in-place without using additional storage.

#Stability: Selection Sort is not stable, meaning it does not preserve the relative order of equal elements.

#In-Place Sorting: The algorithm sorts the array in-place, without requiring extra memory for another array.

#Efficient for Small Arrays: Though Selection Sort is inefficient for large datasets, it can be useful for small arrays or partially sorted data.

#Simple Implementation: Selection Sort is easy to implement and understand, making it a good choice for educational purposes, despite its inefficiency for large datasets.
